    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>In this project, we expanded the cloth simulation project to include fracture simulation for 2D and 3D objects.
        First, we augmented the spring and mass model for the 2D cloth by adding a max length value to the
        springs. If exceeded, we broke the spring. We experimented with a couple methods for assigning these max length
        values, additionally experimenting with different rules for rendering the mesh once these fractures have
        occurred. This same framework was then expanded to model 3D objects. This came with more advanced rules for
        creating spring mass models, creating these triangle meshes, and breaking this model when fractured. TODO add
        more about 3D

    <h1>Technical Approach</h1>
    <p>
        The main paper that we used for this project was
        <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01900837">this paper</a> as it fit nicely within the spring
        mass model we designed in project 4.
