    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        This project's focus was on extending the cloth simulation of project 4 to simulate materials as they
        fracture and break in different ways. The project consisted of two primary components; code infrastructure
        changes and fracture modeling. Much of the work spent on this project involved making changes to underlying
        structure of the project like enabling forces to act on spheres, introducing resistive elastic forces from
        a mesh on a sphere, and modifying the shaders to enable fractured appearances. On the fracture modeling side,
        we implemented an approach from a paper we found which generated realistic looking tears. We then added our
        own ideas to this approach for more interesting tearing and fracturing effects.
    </p>

    <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
    <h3>Code Infrastructure Changes</h3>
    <h4>Enabling Forces on Spheres</h4>
    <p>
        The first code change necessary to the simulation backbone was to enable spheres to move as forces (e.g.
        gravity)
        are applied. This was necessary so that we could collide spheres with pinned meshes to analyze stretches and
        tears.
    </p>
    <p>
        To make this code change, we simply added a <code>simulate</code> method to the <code>collisionObject</code>
        class that is called for every collision object in the same loop that the cloth's <code>simulate</code> is.
        As well, we added a <code>Vector3D</code> force vector that accumulates forces applied to a sphere. The
        sphere also maintains its first two moments so that we can update its position and velocity as in the
        pointmass mesh. At every simulation step, we update the sphere as a rigid body around its center which
        moves according to the following equations $x_t$
        $$\begin{align} v_t & = k_dv_t + \Delta_t f / m \\ x_t & = x_{t-1} + \Delta_t * v_t \end{align}$$
        where $v$ is velocity, $x$ is position, $k_d$ is a damping coefficient, $f$ is the accumulated force
        vector, and $m$ is the sphere mass.
    </p>
    <p>
        The modeling assumption used here are that the sphere is accurately modeled as a rigid body.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the result of this code change see the first figure in the results.
    </p>

    <h4>Mesh Resistance</h4>
    <p>
        The second code change to enable realistic fracturing was to make the mesh resist the sphere by applying
        an opposing force to the sphere. To enable the cloth to apply a resistive force, we added a constant $k_r$
        to allow us to control the "stretchiness" of the mesh and added the following force point by point on
        a collision to the sphere
        $$k_r||x_a - x_b|| * \frac{c - x_b}{||c - x_b||}$$
        where $x_a$ is the position of a point before sphere displacement, $x_b$ is the position of the point after
        sphere displacement, and $c$ is the center of the sphere.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall this code change involved a small change to implement the equation above and a few larger structural
        changes to how collisions are handled and when sphere moments are updated.
    </p>
    <p>
        The results of this change are in figures 2 and 3 below.
    </p>

    <h4>Shader Changes</h4>
    <p>
        The third major code change we had to make was to enable shaders to show the breaking. To make this change,
        we decided to break in units of triangles for the shader. If a spring is broken, it is marked broken along
        with its point masses. We use this flag as a mask variable to each of the shaders; the shaders set the color
        of a vertex to $(0, 0, 0, 0)$ if it has been broken.
    </p>
    <p>
        The result of this is that the shaders now show holes in the mesh. Although the examples given below are
        jagged, you can image with a higher resolution mesh the breaks appear more fine. Higher resolution meshes
        seemed to slow down our computers unbearably so, and as a result these examples are not included.
    </p>
    <p>
        An example image before this code change is seen in Figure 4. Figures 5 and 6 represent successful breaks
        with the shaders.
    </p>

    <h2>Fracture Modeling</h2>
    <h3>Assigning Fracture Thresholds</h3>
    <h4>Random Fracture Thresholds</h4>
    <p>Our first strategy for assigning fracture thresholds was random assignment. This was suggested in
        <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01900837">this paper</a> so that the fractures would occur
        in arbitrary places and not all at once. In implementing this, we created a max and min threshold parameter, and
        assigned thresholds randomly at uniform within this range. Our results varied greatly depending on how we
        defined this parameter, and required some experimentation. Wider ranges would leave some springs very resistant
        to fracture and leave us with a stringy cloth. Very low thresholds also proved problematic as the cloth would
        splinter and fracture too much, sometimes leaving us without a cloth at all. Some examples are below.
    <div align="center">
        <table style="width=100%">
            <tr>
                <td align="middle">
                    <img width=500px src='images/widerange.png'></img>
                    <figcaption align="middle">Too wide of a range.
                    </figcaption>
                </td>
                <td align="middle">
                    <img width=500px src='images/splinter.png'></img>
                    <figcaption align="middle">Too low of a range.</figcaption>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    Overall, we found the best range to be 1.3, 1.8 for most cases. We also noticed that this range was a function of
    the spring constant. It would be interesting to determine a relationship between the two instead of tweaking each
    individually. Instead of this, however, we moved on to more complicated ways of assigning the spring constant.
    </p>
    <h4>Systematic Assignment</h4>
    <p>One problem we noticed with the randomized fracture was that any fractures not at the point of contact looked
        very unrealistic when the shaders were enabled. There would be random holes that did not make sense.
        Looking for a solution, we tried a more deterministic way of assigning thresholds. This allowed us to model more
        realisic looking tears and heavily control the behavior of the mesh.
        For this, we created cloths where there were only one or two columns in the mesh which had fracture
        thresholds. Here is an example:
        <br>
        <!-- <iframe src='images/middle-tear.mov'></iframe> -->
        <br>
        As you can see, the shaders do not have strange holes and the cloth tears in a fairly realistic manner, widening
        the one large tear as the sphere pushes through, instead of creating a small hole in the middle and random ones
        on the side.

        This was rendered at a very high cloth resolution as this made the cloth tears look less blocky and more
        realistic. This decreased the speed of the simulation greatly.

        Although these results allow us more freedom to create realistic looking tears, this strategy is not easily
        expanded. Each new affect has to be implemented by hand, and the parameters have to be tweaked after this to get
        just the right looking cloth. Thus, we moved on to a more complex strategy that was both random and systematic.
    </p>


    <h4>Centroid Assignment</h4>
    <p>
        One addition off of the papers we based this project on is centroid assignment. The goal of centroid
        assignment is to break the cloth into shards or chunks for more chunked fracture than
        the previous implementations gave.
    </p>
    <p>
        The changes needed to implement this threshold assignment begin before mesh creation. First, we choose
        $k$ centroids at random across the mesh (where $k$ is a configurable parameter). We experimented with two
        random centroid methods; choosing uniformly at random across the mesh and choosing from a gaussian centered
        at the center of the mesh and capped at the edges.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the centroids are determined, we cluster the pointmasses according to nearest centroid, that is
        $$cluster_x = \text{argmin}_i ||c_i - x||_2$$
        where $c_i$ is the ith centroid and $x$ is the pointmass in question. The threshold for each spring is
        then randomly chosen as in the previous two methods if the spring's pointmasses are in different clusters
        and the threshold is set to infinity for springs whose points lie in the same cluster. As a result, when the
        cloth fractures it shatters into shards. See the section on <b>Shard Fracture</b> for results.
    </p>

    <h3>Fracture Behavior</h3>
    <h4>Spring Only Fracture</h4>
    <p>
        Determining when and where to fracture the springs is only half the battle. After marking a spring as fractured,
        we have a lot of freedom to determine the behavior of the mesh and the rendering. Our first strategy was to make
        each spring dissapear after it was fractured. This, as we soon learned, only worked for the wireframe, and
        sometimes left springs hanging alone in the air or produced other strange affects.
        Attempting to remedy these strange affects and correct the shaders, we decided to mark each triangle connected
        to the spring, and mask these fractured triangles within the shaders. This however, did not work as it exposed
        the triangle mesh structure in the cloth and made it look very unrealistic.
    </p>

    <h4>Point Mass and Spring Fracture</h4>
    <h4>Shard Fracture</h4>
    <p>
        Shard fracture builds off centroid assignment for fracture modeling. Shard fracture can be broken down
        into two behaviors.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first behavior of shard fracturing is to simply use the thresholds defined by centroid assignment.
        As a result, it is impossible for springs to fracture unless they lie on the boundary between two 
        paritions of the mesh. This results in a kind of seam-aligned fracture that may be more realistic for
        materials than the approach of randomly assigning thresholds. Essentially the difference here is between
        more realistic random tears versus less realistic random holes.
    </p>
    <p>
        A visualization of this random tearing is below
    </p>
    <div align="middle">
        <img src="images/Shard_Seam.gif" width="300px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Shard Seam Behavior</figcaption>
    </div>
    <p>
        The second behavior shard fracture implements is sharded fracture. That is, completely fracturing the
        shards into clusters. This is useful for shattering things like glass and plastics. To implement this
        effect we simply unpin all vertices and remove all edges that cross clusters upon initial collision.
        Of course, this is missing some realism, but the fracturing into shards - the key contribution - is
        achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
        A visualization of the sharded fracture is seen below.
    </p>

        <img src="images/shard_shard.gif" width="300px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Sharded Fracture Behavior</figcaption>
    </div>
    <p>
        One problem we encountered while rendering this simulation was that the cloth would stick to the sphere
        as a result of the naive sphere intersection code. To remedy this, we changed the code to conform each
        spring to stay the same length after each timestep instead of 1.1 times its length. This pulled the
        vertices away from the sphere and helped our fracture look better.
    </p>

    <h3>Other Challenges and Lessons Learned</h3>
    <p>
        Apart from the challenges and problems faced we had one major challenge that we weren't able to overcome.
        In particular, we had planned in our milestones to do 3D simulations with lattices of cubes. However, after
        spending exorbitant amounts of time trying to render a new mesh structure, we abandoned this pursuit in
        favor of more 2D results. A suggestion for future improvement of this would be to implement 3D strucutres
        as the current fracture code could translate directly to a correctly implemented mesh.
    </p>
    <p>
        As well, a lesson we learned along the way was just how important random mesh structures are for realism.
        Our experiments that didn't have random thresholds looked far less realistic than our experiments with
        random tears and thresholds. It has proven almost necessary to add randomness to a physical model in order
        to simulate surface and structural defects.
