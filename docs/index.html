        <p>
            In this project, I created a simulation of a piece of cloth. Yes, just a piece of cloth. Yet this is much
            more difficult than one would think. Within this simulation, there are many parameters that you can tweak in
            order to achieve the type of cloth and level of realism you would like. Here is a project showing all of the
            important aspects to keep in mind when trying to simulate movement and collisions, and realistic lighting
            and materials.
        </p>
        <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Masses and Springs</h2>
        <p>In this part of the project, I implemented the construction of a spring mass system. Due to the 2D like
            nature of cloth, this system was 2D, and contained springs in the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal
            directions, and also included springs attached to every other point. Here are some images of this
            mass-spring system.</p>

        <h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
        <p>In this part of the project, I used verelet integration to update each point masses position based on the
            forces acting upon it. This allowed me to realistically simulate a cloth responding to the affects of
            gravity. In this simulation, there are a couple parameters that we can modify to change the nature of the
            simulation: ks, density, and damping. Ks is the value of the spring constant in Hooke's Law, and modifies
            the amount of force a spring applies when it is stretched or squashed. Increasing this value makes the cloth
            look much more rigid and resistant to gravity. There is a lot less bending in the cloth as you can see in
            the image below. Reducing this value has the opposite affect, the cloth is much "looser" looking and there
            are more wrinkles introduced in the cloth's final resting spot as you can see below.</p>
        <div align="center">

        <p>Density is used in the calculation of the mass of the cloth, and thus affects the force and acceleration of
            the cloth. Therefore, the cloth responds to gravitational pull differently when we change the density. As
            you can see in the first image, the cloth with a lower density is being pulled down by gravity much more
            noticeably. The fold at the top of the cloth is much larger and pronounced than the cloth with the higher
            density. The cloth with the higher density still sags, but the wrinkles in the cloth are much smaller and
            less pronounced.

            Damping is a percentage value that denotes how much of the energy in the simulation is lost at each time
            step. This is to simulate the natural energy "loss" due to heat and friction, and also so that our
            simulations do not get out of hand. The higher this value is, the less energetic the entire simulation
            looks. The cloth bounces much less and moves less distances when the damping is higher because more of this
            energy is being lost. When it is very low, the opposite affect happens and the objects seem to bounce around
            much more lively.
        </p>

        <h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
        <p>In this section, I implemented collisions with other objects. This means that when a point intersected a
            sphere or plane, its position was modified/corrected so that it was no longer intersecting the plane. Here
            is an image of the cloth draped over the sphere as it has collided with it.

        <p>As you can see from the images above, the different ks values modified the resulting image greatly. The cloth
            with the very high ks looks much more rigid and resistant to being draped around the sphere. This is because
            the high ks constant makes this cloth much more resistant to bending or shearing as these springs exert a
            lot of force when they are displaced. On the other side of the coin, the cloth with the very low ks constant
            is very "soft" looking and is draped around the sphere very closely, and with lots of bends. This is because
            of the opposite reason: the springs do not exert much force and therefore are more susceptible to being
            disformed.</p>

        <h2>Part 4: Self Collision</h2>
        In this section, I implemented self collision so that the cloth does not cross itself and instead folds like
        normal cloths do. This was done in a similar fashion to the previous collision tests, except I took an average
        of the collision vectors since often there are multiple self collisions at once. Here are some images of the
        cloth folding on itself without colliding/intersecting itself.
        <div>
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>

                </tr>
                <tr>

        </div>
        <br><br>

        When you increase the ks of the cloth, the cloth resists folding more and more. As you can see in the images
        below, the cloth with the very high ks has much fewer folds and is more smooth looking. This is because the
        springs are exerting more force on the other points in the mesh and therefore exerting more force away from
        itself and resisting folds. At a lower ks, there are much more folds as these springs exert less forces.
        <div align="center">
            <table style="width=100%">
                <tr>
                    <td align="middle">
                        <img src="images/foldk500.png" width="480px" />

        When you increase the density of the cloth, it looks to be more bumpy than cloths with lower density. This is
        shown in the images below. Since the density increases the mass of the cloth, this increases the amount of
        gravitational force that is applied to the cloth. This makes the springs bend out of place more and gives the
        cloth a more bump look than the less dense cloths. This also causes the cloth with the higher density to look
        more "bouncy" or move more and resist a restful state.

        <h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
        <p>A shader is a program that modifies exactly one vertex or one fragment at a time. It is designed this way so
            that we can apply this program to each vertex on a mesh or each fragment on a mesh very quickly and
            efficiently. This is used to create all sorts of interesting affects, and in this project we use these
            shaders to create interesting looking materials and affects on our cloth. As you can see from the results
            below, there are a wide range of things you can do with the shaders. Vertex shaders modify the vertices of a
            mesh only, and its results are then interpolated across the triangles using barycentric interpolation. These
            results can then be passed to the fragment shaders. Fragment shaders modify each fragment, or pixel in this
            case, of the mesh, thus modifying the mesh more finely, and often use the information calculated in a vertex
            shader. You can see some examples of this below.</p>

        <br>
        <p>The blinn-phong shading model is a way of shading an object in a pseudo-realistic manner. It has three
            components: the ambient lighting, the diffuse lighting, and the specular lighting. All three are combined in
            various ways to make different looking materials. The specular lighting defines how "shiny" an object looks
            as it emulates the lighting reflections we get from objects. Diffuse lighing shows the average direct
            lighting we get from lighting so as to increase the realism of the lighting, and ambient lighting is a
            uniform addition of light to an object in order to emulate indirect lighting that happens in the real world.
            Here are some images of the different elements of phong shading to show this affect more meaningfully.</p>

        <p>While the two approaches are both trying to achieve same affect: a less smooth looking cloth/ a textured
            cloth, they differ greatly in their results. Bump mapping achieves a textured looking surface by modifying
            the normals of a rather smooth surface in order to gain the different lighting affects that come from bumpy
            surfaces. The results using this technique are shown below. Displacement mapping achieves a textured affect
            by actually making the cloth bumpy. It changes the actual geometry of the mesh and therefore also achieves
            the lighing affects that come with a bumpy surface. This makes the cloth look more realistic along the
            edges, as you can see the cloth is not toally flush with the sphere or draped nicely around it like it is
            when using the bump mapping shader.

        <p>
            One thing to note is that displacement mapping is much more reliant on the geometry of the mesh, and
            therefore changes greatly when we change the coarseness of the mesh. The images above are rendered with a
            much coarser mesh, whereas the images below are using a much more fine mesh. As you can see, the bump
            mapping is very similar to the one before, whereas the displacement mapping looks much different. The bumps
            are less pronounced and the texture is much more smooth than before. This is because modifying the normals
            has a smaller footprint on the mesh than with a coarser one. </p>
